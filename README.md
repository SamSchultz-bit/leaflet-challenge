# leaflet-challenge
Leaflet Challenge is my submission for the Module 15 Challenge for UMN Data Analysis Bootcamp

## Description
I used Leaflet to visualize a map with an overlayed bubble chart showing thelocation, depth, and magnitude of each earthquake that occured in the last 7 days. I included a pop-up with additional information and a legend.
